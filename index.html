Part I

Answer the following questions:

- What git command creates a branch?
    git checkout -b
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
    fast-forward merges only work if the original branch remains untouched while the new branch is being modified.
- What git command changes to another branch?
    git checkout
- What git command deletes a branch?
    git branch -D
- How do merge conflicts happen?
    Git doesn't know which file to use because it has been committed with modifications multiple times stemming from the same original file.

Part II

Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
